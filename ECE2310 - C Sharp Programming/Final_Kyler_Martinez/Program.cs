/*
 * Abstract class Store acts as the parent and the childern are MultiLine & SingleLine
 * 
 * Polymorphism is seen since each child has a different implementation of the response time method
 * and while in an array they use that specific one. I explicty called the response_time method to better
 * show dynamic binding, originally I just stored the response in a variable and called it.
 * 
 * See Q3 for operator overloading
 * 
 * Q1: A foreach loop is made that iterates through an array of stores to output the data which was formatted by
 * Note: the response times are not rounded and I did not want to mess with the NET type and select the wrong one, sorry about that.
 *
 * Q2: The method sorting takes in an array of stores and then sorts them so that the array begins at the lowest response time and ascends from there. 
 * 
 * Q3: Through operator overloading, when two stores are added, the response times are added and returned.
 * This was done using the store class to allow for stores of differing types to be added.
