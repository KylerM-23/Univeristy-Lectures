/*
 These are personal notes - Kyler
 Q1: What is the average (total) assets of the investment during this period?
Line 35 will output this

Q2: Which day will the invester have the highest asset?  How much is it?
line 33 will output this

Q3: Which day will the invester have the least amount of assets? How much is it?
line 34 will output this

Requirements:

1. The project must apply encapsulation, e.g., using classes  
I used the classes Stock & Investor.

2. The project must apply composition
Investor has a data member for each stock object.

3. The project must use ToString method(s) to print out information
I have one in both Investor & Stock to print general info.

4. The project must demonstrate the use of static member(s)
I have a static member for the random object in Stock and for the period length in Investor.

5. The project must answer the above questions correctly.


Notes:
I could improve using an array to keep track of stocks whihc will allow for n stock as opposed to the hardcoded 2.
